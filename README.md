# 2048-Game
 
The 2048 Puzzle Game is a sliding tile puzzle game that challenges players to combine numbered tiles on a grid to create a tile with the number 2048. Players move tiles by swiping in four directions (up, down, left, or right), and when two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a single tile with their values summed. The goal is to reach the tile numbered 2048, but the game continues after reaching this milestone for those aiming for higher scores.

Core Features:

-4x4 grid: Classic grid layout where tiles merge and new ones appear after each move.
-Tile Merging Mechanism: Merging two tiles of the same value to create a new tile with their sum.
-Game Over Detection: Game ends when no moves are left on the grid.
-Score System: Keep track of the playerâ€™s score as tiles merge.
-Victory Condition: Player wins upon creating a tile with the number 2048.
-Restart Functionality: Allows players to start a new game anytime.

Technologies:

-Game Engine: Unity (or any preferred engine).
-Programming Language: C# for game logic and mechanics.
-UI/UX: Simple and intuitive interface with smooth animations when tiles merge.

Future Enhancements:

-Add a leaderboard to track high scores globally.
-Introduce difficulty levels or larger grids (e.g., 5x5 or 6x6) for advanced players.
-Include theme customization options for tiles and backgrounds.
